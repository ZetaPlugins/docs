## Contributing

We always welcome feedback, suggestions, and contributions from the community.

To contribute, please submit a pull request to the relevant repository. Each project may have its own contributing guidelines, so be sure to check those first.

You can also share your feedback or ideas in our official [Discord server](https://strassburger.org/discord).

If you're interested in helping translate a plugin, please refer to that plugin's documentation. Most of our plugins use GitLocalize for translations, but you're also welcome to submit a pull request with the appropriate translation files.
