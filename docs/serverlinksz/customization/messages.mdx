## Formatting

ServerLinksZ uses a text library called MiniMessage. MiniMessage allows for better formatting and adds text click effects, gradients etc. You can read up on the formatting here:

## Localization

ServerLinksZ is fully localized. You can change the language of the plugin by changing the `lang` option in the config.yml file.

The language files are located in the `lang` folder. You can add your own language files by creating a new file in the `lang` folder and adding the language code to the `lang` option in the config.yml file. Alternatively you can just modify the existing language files to your liking.

If you want to contribute your own language file, please do so by creating a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/KartoffelChipss/ServerLinksZ) or use [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/9890).
