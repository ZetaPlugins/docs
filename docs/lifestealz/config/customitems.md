# ðŸ’Ž Custom Items

:::danger
If you want to delete the custom item with the ID `defaultheart`, you will have to change the `heartItem` settings in the `config.yml` file to another item ID.
:::

You can find all the custom items in the `items.yml` file. Here you can add as many items as you want. Each item follows this pattern:

```yaml
itemId: # <- This is the item id that can be used in recipes and for permissions
    name: "&cHeart"
    lore:
        - "&7Rightclick to use"
        - "This would be a second line"
    material: "NETHER_STAR"
    enchanted: false
    customModelData: 100
    customItemType: "heart"
    customHeartValue: 1
    minHearts: 0
    maxHearts: -1
    requirePermission: false
    craftable: true
    recipes:
        1:
            rowOne:
                - "GOLD_BLOCK"
                - "GOLD_BLOCK"
                - "GOLD_BLOCK"
            rowTwo:
                - "OBSIDIAN"
                - "NETHER_STAR"
                - "OBSIDIAN"
            rowThree:
                - "DIAMOND_BLOCK"
                - "DIAMOND_BLOCK"
                - "DIAMOND_BLOCK"
    sound:
        enabled: true
        sound: ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP
        volume: 1.0
        pitch: 1.0
```

### General item properties:

-   Replace `itemId` with an id for your item (only letters recommended), that will be used for permissions and commands.
-   `name` refers to the name of the item ([Formatting rules](messages.md#formatting) apply here)
-   `lore` is a list lines, that will be displayed as the item description. You can use `" "` for an empty line and the general [formatting rules](messages.md#formatting). You can add as many lines as you want.
-   `material` refers to the type of the item (e.g. Nether Star, Stick, Diamond Pickaxe). You can use any material from [this list](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html).
-   `enchanted`: Set this to `true` if you item should have an enchant glint.

### Custom Textures

If you want to apply a custom texture from a TexturePack, you can set the `customModelData` property to whatever you need.

If you don't know how to apply textures using custom model data, I would recommend [this video](https://youtu.be/x2QwKFE0aQg?si=1ZQfsXmTgk5f9xfi&t=122).

### Crafting

If you want your item to be craftable in a crafting table, you can set `craftable` to `true`.

You can add as many recipes as you want, by adding another recipe id (like the `1`in the example) with three rows each.

Every recipe has a `rowOne`, `rowTwo` and `rowThree` representing the first three rows in the crafting table. Each row has a list of three [Materials](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html), that represent the three items in that crafting table row. Instead of a Material, you can also use:

-   `AIR`or `empty`for an empty slot in the crafting grid
-   the id of another custom item (e.g. `defaultheart`)&#x20;
-   block or item tags by putting a `#` in front of the tag (e.g. `#logs` or `#wool`)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="recipe" label="Recipe" default>
    ```yaml
    recipes:
      1:
        rowOne:
          - "GOLD_BLOCK"
          - "GOLD_BLOCK"
          - "GOLD_BLOCK"
        rowTwo:
          - "OBSIDIAN"
          - "NETHER_STAR"
          - "OBSIDIAN"
        rowThree:
          - "DIAMOND_BLOCK"
          - "DIAMOND_BLOCK"
          - "DIAMOND_BLOCK"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="crafting-table" label="Crafting Table">
    ![Crafting Table](/img/recipe.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Custom Item Behavior

-   `requirePermission`: If this is set to true, players will need to have the `lifestealz.item.itemid` permission, where `itemid` is the ID of your item.
-   `customItemType` can be either `none`, `heart` or `revive`.
    -   `none`: This item will have no special functionality and can be used in other LifeStealZ crafting recipes for example.
    -   `heart`: This item will grant the user one or multiple hearts (see further config options in this category)
    -   `revive`: This will make the item act as revive item. Players can use this item to revive eliminated players.
-   `customHeartValue`: Here you can set how many hearts a user should get when using this item (only works when `customItemType` is set to `heart`)
-   `minHearts`: Here you can set the minimum amount of hearts a user needs to already have to be able to use this item.
-   `maxHearts`: Here you can set the maximum amount of hearts a user can have to be able to use this item. Setting it to -1 will disable this.

### Custom Sound

If you want your to customize the sound your heart item makes when consuming it, you can refer to the `sound` section. You can use any sound from [this list](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Sound.html) as well as setting the volume and pitch. If you want, you can also disable the sound completely.
