# ðŸ’» Installation

### 1. Download the Plugin:

To install LifeStealZ on your server, you first need to download the latest version of LifeStealZ from a trusted platform such as [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/lifestealz/versions), or any other **official** platform.

:::warning
**Be alert:** This plugin is only available on its official [GitHub](https://github.com/KartoffelChipss/LifeStealZ), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/lifestealz), and [Hangar](https://hangar.papermc.io/KartoffelChipss/LifestealZ) pages. Any versions found on third-party sites like 9Minecraft.net are **unauthorized and may contain malware**. Always download from official sources to stay safe.
:::

### 2. Upload:

After downloading the `.jar` file, upload it to the `plugins` directory of your server. If your host provides you with a panel, this directory is often found under a section named `Files` or `File Manager`.

### 3. Finalizing

Before you can play with LifeStealZ, you'll have to restart the server once, so the plugin can be loaded.

If you want to check that LifeStealZ is installed correctly, you can either try to use the `/lsz` command or use `/pl` and check if LifeStealZ is green.

If either of these commands fail, or provide an error, seek [_support_](https://strassburger.org/discord)!
