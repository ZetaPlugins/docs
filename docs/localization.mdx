You want to help translate one of our plugins? Here you'll learn how.

We are using a tool called GitLocalize to manage translations for LifeStealZ. If you want to contribute to the translations, you'll need to sign in to [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com/) with a GitHub Account. If you don't already have one, you can create one [here](https://github.com/signup).

## Translateable Plugins

Here is a list of our plugins that are currently using GitLocalize for translations:

- [LifeStealZ](https://gitlocalize.com/repo/9581)

## How to contribute

To start translating, follow these steps:

1. Go to the GitLocalize page of the plugin you want to translate.
2. Click on the "Sign in with GitHub" button and authorize GitLocalize to access your GitHub account.
3. Once signed in, you'll see a list of languages. Click on the language you want to translate.
4. You will see a list of files that can be translated. Click on a file to start translating.
5. For each string, you can enter your translation in the text box provided. Make sure to keep the original meaning and context of the string.
6. After you are done translating, create a review request by clicking the yellow button in the top right corner.

If the language, you want to translate to is not yet present in the list, please open a ticket on the [Discord](https://strassburger.org/discord).

## Discord Role

When you have contributed to translations, you can request a Translator role in the [Discord Server](https://strassburger.org/discord). This role will give you access to the #translations channel, where you can discuss translations with other translators and the plugin developers.
