# Getting Started

To begin, you'll need to create a clicker block. To do this, look at a block in the game and run the following command:

```bash
/cc clicker add <name>
```

This will create a clicker block at the location you're looking at.

:::info
If you'd like a hologram to appear above the clicker block, install [DecentHolograms](https://modrinth.com/plugin/decentholograms) and ensure the `hologram` option is enabled in the config.
:::

Once your clicker block is placed:
- **Left-click** the block to collect cookies.
- **Right-click** the block to open the clicker menu. This menu shows your current cookies, available upgrades, achievements, the prestige system, and the toplist.
