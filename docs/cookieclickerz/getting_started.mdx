# Getting Started

To get started, you'll have to first create a clicker block. You do this by using the `/cc clicker add <name>` command while looking at a block. 

This will create a clicker block at the location you are looking at.

You can then left-click the block to collect cookies. 

You can right-click the block to open the clicker menu, where you can see your current cookies, upgrades, achievements, prestige menu and toplist.
